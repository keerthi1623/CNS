PRELAB DISCUSSION and PROCEDURE:

1.Configure and Use Snort IDS on Windows
Steps to configure Snort on Widnows machine and how to use it for detection of attacks.

2. Steps:

	1. Download Snort from "http://www.snort.org/" website.
	2. Also download Rules from the same website. You need to sign up to get rules for registered users.
	3. Click on the Snort_(version-number)_Installer.exe file to install it. By-default it will install snort in
	   the "C:\Snort" directory.
4. Extract downloaded Rules file: snortrules-snapshot-(number).tar.gz

5. Copy all files from the "rules" directory of the extracted folder and paste them into "C:\Snort\rules"
directory.

6. Copy "snort.conf" file from the "etc" directory of the extracted folder and paste it into
"C:\Snort\etc" directory. Overwrite existing file if there is any.

7. Open command prompt (cmd.exe) and navigate to directory "C:\Snort\bin" directory.

8. To execute snort in sniffer mode use following command:
    snort -dev -i 2
    -i indicate interface number.
    -dev is used to run snort to capture packets.
    To check interface list use following command: snort -W

9. To execute snort in IDS mode, we need to configure a file "snort.conf" according to our network
environment.

10. Set up network address we want to protect in snort.conf file. To do that look for "HOME_NET"
and add your IP address.
    var HOME_NET 10.1.1.17/8

11. You can also set addresses or DNS_SERVERS, if you have any. otherwise go to the next step.

12. Change RULE_PATH variable with the path of rules directory.
    var RULE_PATH c:\snort\rules

13. Change the path of all libraries with the name and path on your system. or change path
of snort_dynamicpreprocessorvariable.
     sor file C:\Snort\lib\snort_dynamiccpreprocessor\sf_dcerpc.dll
     You need to do this to all library files in the "C:\Snort\lib" directory. The old path might be
    something like: "/usr/local/lib/...". you need to replace that path with you system path.

14. Change path of the "dynamicengine" variable value in the "snort.conf" file with the path of your
system. Such as:
    dynamicengine C:\Snort\lib\snort_dynamicengine\sf_engine.dll

15 Add complete path for "include classification.config" and "include reference.config" files.
     include c:\snort\etc\classification.config
     include c:\snort\etc\reference.config

16. Remove the comment on the line to allow ICMP rules, if it is alredy commented.
    include $RULE_PATH/icmp.rules

17. Similary, remove the comment of ICMP-info rules comment, if it is already commented.
    include $RULE_PATH/icmp-info.rules

18 To add log file to store alerts generated by snort, search for "output log" test and add following
line:
    output alert_fast: snort-alerts.ids

19. Comment whitelist $WHITE_LIST_PATH/white_list.rules and blacklist
    $BLACK_LIST_PATH/black_list.rules lines. Also ensure that you add change the line above
    $WHITE_LIST_PATH
    Change nested_ip inner , \ to nested_ip inner #, \

20. Comment following lines:
    #preprocessor normalize_ip4
#preprocessor normalize_tcp: 
    ips ecn stream
    #preprocessor normalize_icmp4
    #preprocessor normalize_ip6
    #preprocessor normalize_icmp6

21. Save the "snort.conf" file and close it.

22. Go to the "C:\Snort\log" directory and create a file: snort-alerts.ids

23. To start snort in IDS mode, run following command:
    snort -c c:\snort\etc\snort.conf -l c:\snort\log -i 2
    Above command will generate log file that will not be readable without using a tool. To read it use
    following command:
     C:\Snort\Bin\> snort -r ..\log\log-filename
    To generate Log files in ASCII mode use following command while running snort in IDS mode:
     snort -A console -i2 -c c:\Snort\etc\snort.conf -l c:\Snort\log -K ascii

24. Scan the computer running snort from another computer using PING or launch attack. Then
check snort-alerts.ids file the log folder.
